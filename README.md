# Convolutional-Neural-Networks-for-CINIC-10-Image-Classification
A Python script that trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the CINIC-10 dataset using PyTorch.

# Description 
This project trains a CNN model on CINIC-10, a challenging extension of CIFAR-10 that blends CIFAR and downsampled ImageNet samples to better reflect real-world image variability.
The script includes:
 - Data loading from a user-provided CINIC-10 folder
 - Custom CNN model using PyTorch
 - Training, validation, and testing loops
 - Accuracy and loss tracking

# Features 
 - Designed for CINIC-10: Training, validation, and test splits pre-configured
 - PyTorch-based model with flexibility for extensions
 - GPU acceleration support
 - Basic metrics tracking (loss/accuracy)
 - Easily adaptable to deeper models (e.g., ResNet, VGG)

# Warning 
Make sure the CINIC-10 dataset path is correctly set in the script (default: ./data/cinic-10)
